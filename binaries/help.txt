Available command-line options:

  --help
      Displays this help text.

  --server (server address)
      Connects directly to the specified server, rather than displaying a list
      of servers and allowing the user to choose which server to connect to.
      Server address may be a domain name or an IP address, and may include a
      port number after a colon.  Example:  --server server.example.com:43444

  --portal (server address)
      Uses this portal server instead of portal.multiplayermapeditor.com.
      This is almost identical to --server, the only difference being that
      your saved login info will be sent to this server, and the game will
      behave as if this is the one true login and server list server.

  --packets
      Displays a dump of all packets received from the map server.
