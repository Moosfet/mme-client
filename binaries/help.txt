Available command-line options:

  --help
      Displays this help text.

  --server (server address)
      Connects directly to the specified server, rather than displaying a list
      of servers and allowing the user to choose which server to connect to.
      Server address may be a domain name or an IP address, and may include a
      port number after a colon.  Example:  --server server.example.com:43444

  --packets
      Displays a dump of all packets received from the map server.
